# Phobian Odyssey
A dungeon crawler engine for GZDoom, originally written for NaNoWADMo 2021.

Phobian Odyssey is a tile-based dungeon crawler game based on the Doom assets and the GZDoom engine. The player explores dungeon maps in a grid movement, encounters treasures and events, and fights random encounters using more conventional Doom gameplay. Items bought or found in the dungeon are kept in a small inventory, and the player can rearrange and use them when they choose.

Cash and materials are used to buy supplies at stores. Monsters that are encountered in the dungeons drop cash, ammo, health and materials on defeat. Some monsters have special conditions under which they have to be killed to drop bonus items.
